# Meeting


#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- The agenda was added on time and follows the template project.
- The agenda points included are chronologically structure and I especially liked the fact that you included a summary of goals for the week at the end of the agenda
- The only thing is that I feel like some points weren't really discussed in the meeting or could have been a little more discussion on them e.g issues and milestones. Make sure to use the agenda as a somewhat strict plan for the meeting.





#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- The minutes go into quite bit of depth and contain the most important information that was discussed in the meeting. 
- I really like how you made sure that most action points were assigned to specific people in the team.
- Moreover, the minutes were added shortly after the meeting and are clearly structured. 


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- I think you did a good job as the chair. You immediately took charge of the meeting stayed in charge throughout the entire meeting.
- Your agenda points encourage some very nice discussion between the team and you raised good questions about the future weeks. 
- I also really like how as the chair you shared some proactive ideas to make sure the team is on track, such as going through the entire app to highlight any issues.



#### Attitude & Relation

#### Potentially Shippable Product


Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- There was some great progress done in the entire app during these holidays.
- The team has managed to have some implementation for the majority of the features with only having a few bullet points/bugs to fix. 
- The team is on a great track to delievering a very high end product by the end of the project.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- I really liked how you did not only discuss the tasks you completed the previous week, but also discussed the future tasks and prioritazion between them. It was very nice how you were already thinking about refactoring and UI choices.  
- The distribution of tasks is divided fairly equally, and every team member has completed all their action points, shown by the progress in the app.
