# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback:
The agenda was added to the repository some time before the meeting. I liked how you included many questions to discuss within the group. I would just say to keep in mind the time estimates, despite the meeting starting a little late, the meeting was shorter than expected.

 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
The minutes were added to the repo shortly after the meeting. The notes were quite clear and went into the right amount of depth. I am aware that this wasn't really applicable to the previous meeting, but keep in mind for future meetings that the minutes should contain some clear realistic action points for each person.


#### Chair performance

Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: 
I am aware that there were some technical difficulties with regards to accessing the agenda at the beginning of the meeting, which made the meeting start a little slower, but I did also feel that other members were more focused on getting the meeting started, rather than the chair. I did enjoy how you're questions in the agenda encouraged other members to share their opinions openly on the project, however, I felt like at certain points during the meeting, the minute taker took a little over the meeting, and kept the meeting flowing by making sure that all the points in the agenda were discussed.

 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback:
I think this team did a great job in this section. You openly discussed your opinions and heard each other out. I also really like how you were openly sharing your ideas and tips to other members on how to get started with the project. The overall atmosphere of the meeting was quite constructive and everyone contributed to the discussion. Keep this work up!



#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 
I think the team did a great job with getting started with the project. Some great progress in both the frontend and backend, allowing the users to add notes and edit titles, while sucessfully saving the data in the database. The team is on a good track to developing a working application by the end!



#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Mark: Good

Feedback: 
The group seems to have completed the action list of last week, by finishing the code of conduct and managing to get a nice schema of the app. I also like how you distributed the tasks for this week and made issues for these. I'm really looking forward to the progress you'll make in the next week!
